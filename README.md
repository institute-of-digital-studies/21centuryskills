## Welcome to 21 century skills

We are a non-profit that gives talents access to skills and projects for the 21st cen-
tury.

We do this by selecting and following the best online courses, project-based
and with teams and trainers.

We set up cost-effective but nice locations and improve our program in-
frastructure together.

Our program is cost-effective and scalable to other countries.
We have a selection process to identify the talents that can match our program.

## What we organized next ?

We are a non-profit that gives talents access to skills and projects for the 21st cen-
tury.

We do this by selecting and following the best online courses, project-based
and with teams and trainers.

We set up cost-effective but nice locations and improve our program in-
frastructure together.

Our program is cost-effective and scalable to other countries.
We have a selection process to identify the talents that can match our program.

The program will start with an online course called “CS50 - an introduction to the
art and science of programming”. To be completed in 4 months. We will work with
the participants towards completion certificates.
Students will need at least 30 hours per week, around 40 on average, with
large upwards and downwards variance.
There will be three compulsory workshop weeks. Students can take five weeks
of holiday.

Every student, as part of its duty, will take part in a committee that helps to sup-
port or improve the program.
## CS50 (Computer Science Introduction)

Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art
of programming. This course teaches students how to think algorithmically
and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data

structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, and software en-
gineering. Languages include C, Python, and SQL plus students’ choice of:

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for web development); Java or Swift (for mobile
app development); or Lua (for game development). Problem sets inspired
by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. Course culminates in
a final project. Designed for concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with
or without prior programming experience. Two thirds of CS50 students have
never taken CS before. Among the overarching goals of this course are to
inspire students to explore unfamiliar waters, without fear of failure, create

an intensive, shared experience, accessible to all students, and build com-
munity among students.
